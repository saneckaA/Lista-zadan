# To Do List

## Description
In this project I've made an app that allows you to make your to-do list. After adding a new task you can mark it as done by clicking the green button. 
The sign "✓" will appear and the whole task will be crossed out. If you want to mark all tasks as done click the button "Ukończ wszystkie". You can also hide all done tasks by clicking the button "Ukryj zrobione" or remove a single task from your list by clicking the red bin button.

## How it works:
