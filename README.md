# To Do List

## Description
In this project I've made an app which allows you to make your own to do list. After adding a new task you can mark it as done by clicking the green button. 
The sign "âœ“" will appear and the whole task will be crossed out. You can also remove a task from your list by clicking the bin button. 

## How it works:
